# Fourier-Cycloides

ESIEA 2nd year Student project 

collaborator : 
An0n1mity

The project was to create a program where the user enters a svg file and the program draw it thanks to Fourier's transform

/!\ The fourier transform is not optimized at all, it was made only by maths understanding and thanks to the 3b1b video /!\

Check An0n1mity's repository who's using a FFT library and GTK

I'll see later if I will update this to create a release and add a more user friendly usage
